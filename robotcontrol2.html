This group project was carried out as a part of the course "Intelligent automation" during my second year at Chalmers University of Technology.

A lot of code was already implemented and as a consequence we had to learn how to jump into an ongoing project.

Things i learned:
- The basics of Robot Operating System 2
- Implementing and using a publisher/subscriber model
- How to implement a planning algorithm
- Implementing and using datastructures like states, predicates, transitions and graphs

Besides implementing the above-mentioned me and my partner wrote the logic necessary for the robotic arms to sort the colored cubes without collision and in a quick, efficient way.
